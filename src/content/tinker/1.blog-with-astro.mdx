## The Experiment

I wanted to build a simple blog using Astro. This is a quick tinker project to explore how Astro works and how to create a blog with it.

## What I Learned

- Using Astro components for layout and structure
- Fetching and displaying content from Markdown files

## Next Steps

- Add more features
- Improve error handling
- Create better documentation
