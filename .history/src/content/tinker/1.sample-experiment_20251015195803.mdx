## The Experiment

I wanted to build a simple CLI tool to automate some of my daily workflow tasks. This is a quick tinker project to explore how CLI tools work under the hood.

## What I Learned

- Using Commander.js for parsing command-line arguments
- Creating interactive prompts with inquirer
- Publishing to npm registry

## Next Steps

- Add more commands
- Improve error handling
- Create better documentation
