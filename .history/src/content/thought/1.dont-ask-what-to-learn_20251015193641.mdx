title: "Don't Ask 'What to Learn'"
description: "Don't start by asking 'what to learn.' It's the wrong approach. If you don't know where you're going, how will you know when you get there?"

Think about it:
- iOS or Android? They're just tools.
- Full stack or web dev? More tools.

The real question is – What do you want to build?

Start there. Figure out what excites you. What problem do you want to solve?

Maybe it's:
- An app to help people exercise more
- A website to connect local farmers with customers
- A game that teaches kids math

Once you know that, the tech choices become clearer.

Plus, motivation matters. Learning is hard. If you're not pumped about the end goal, you'll quit.

I've seen it happen.

A student spent months learning React because it was "hot".
He hated it. Gave up coding entirely.

Don't be that guy.

Pick a project you care about. The right tools will follow.

Remember – Tech changes fast. Your passion? That lasts.
